# Twitter_Data_mining
This  kicks off our journey of mining the social web with Twitter, a rich source
of social data that is a great starting point for social web mining because of its inherent
openness for public consumption, clean and well-documented API, rich developer
tooling, and broad appeal to users from every walk of life. Twitter data is particularly
interesting because tweets happen at the “speed of thought” and are available for con‐
sumption as they happen in near real time, represent the broadest cross-section of so‐
ciety at an international level, and are so inherently multifaceted. Tweets and Twitter’s
“following” mechanism link people in a variety of ways, ranging from short (but often
meaningful) conversational dialogues to interest graphs that connect people and the
things that they care about.
